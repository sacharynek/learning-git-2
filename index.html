Dawn of Eternity - Predicament


Screaming out my senses – is this me dying?
All I’m having disappears - what fore am I fighting?

Still you decide about the life that I live – I am a fool
A plaything, waiting for you punching again – I’m not for free
Nothing can excuse – I know your game
Uprising has begun now

  Close your eyes for one moment, we can still believe
One deep breath, get your focus – with the gun at your head
You don’t own me, you don’t fool me, I am burying your bound
This war is mine
When you’re bringing me pain
