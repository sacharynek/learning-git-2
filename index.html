<h1>Dawn of Eternity - Predicament</h1>


<div class='part'>
Screaming out my senses – is this me dying?
All I’m having disappears - what fore am I fighting?

<br>
Still you decide about the life that I live – I am a fool
A plaything, waiting for you punching again – I’m not for free
Nothing can excuse – I know your game
Uprising has begun now 
<br>

  Close your eyes for one moment, we can still believe
One deep breath, get your focus – with the gun at your head
You don’t own me, you don’t fool me, I am burying your bound
This war is mine
When you’re bringing me pain 
  
  <br>
  Absence of clarity is clouding your eyes. you can’t deny
That the truth you are fighting, and I am trying to forgive – oh god, these lies
I will not listen, you …
<br>
Close your eyes for one moment, we can still believe
One deep breath, get your focus – with the gun at your head
You don’t own me, you don’t fool me, I am burying your bound
This war is mine
When you’re bringing me pain
<br>
The war – is on now
And she – decides
The whore- has spoken
And I’m - alive
<br>
Close your eyes for one moment, we can still believe
One deep breath, get your focus – with the gun at your head
You don’t own me, you don’t fool me, I am burying your bound
This war is mine
When you’re bringing me pain
When you’re bringing me
